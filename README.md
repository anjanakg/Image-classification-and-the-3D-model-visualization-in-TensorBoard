# Image Classification using Deep Learning and the Model Visualization in 3D Space Using TensorBoard

This dataset I collected from Kaggle. 

In this assignment first I built my own sequatial more bird image set classification. Then I visualize it on TensorBoard.
Then I did the transfer learning using VGG16 Model and achived far better results and visualize the results in the TensorBoard.
